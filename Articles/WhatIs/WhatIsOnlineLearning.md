In the realm of high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific computing, online learning resources span a broad range and have become indispensable in enabling practitioners and researchers to stay abreast of the rapidly evolving technological landscape. These resources offer access to cutting-edge tools and techniques and aid in building the skills and knowledge required to efficiently leverage HPC systems and tackle intricate scientific problems.

Universities and specialized online learning companies provide formal, structured and comprehensive courses that cover a broad spectrum of topics, from fundamental programming and data analysis to advanced parallel programming. These courses often provide certifications or credentials that can aid in career growth or demonstrate competence.

Less formal and more specialized training materials offered by supercomputing centers, computing facilities, individual educators, and enthusiasts can be especially valuable in addressing specific challenges or knowledge gaps. Such resources include tutorials, blogs, documentation of various types,  as well as multimedia content such as webinars, video lectures, or  full video+audio+slides 

The availability of both asynchronous and live training events is crucial in providing flexibility and accessibility for learners. Asynchronous resources permit learners to study at their own pace, while live training events provide real-time interaction with instructors and other learners. Other than the convenience of allowing  learners to access materials from anywhere with an internet connection, online learning resources are available 24/7, allowing learners to access them whenever it suits their schedule and in a  format that best suits their learning style. They are most times more cost-effective than live training and when done efficiently, can  provide opportunities for learners to interact with other students and instructors through discussion forums, chat rooms, and other online tools. This can enhance the learning experience and provide a sense of community for learners.

And finally, while the majority of content is available asynchronously (i.e., recorded), many live training events are also available for remote participation. This topic of online learning includes materials that place notable focus on software development, efficiency, and sustainability, as distinct entities from the "scientific" and mathematical aspects of computational science and engineering.
