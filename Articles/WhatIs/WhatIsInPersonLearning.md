In-person learning refers to a training or development program that takes place within the physical workplace or training center, where employees attend courses, workshops, or training sessions in person, rather than through online or remote means. This type of training provides employees with hands-on experience, interactive sessions, and face-to-face interaction with trainers and colleagues.
