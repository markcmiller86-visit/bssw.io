In-person training provides invaluable opportunities for hands-on experience, direct feedback, and meaningful interaction that might be difficult to replicate in other settings.

In-person learning refers to a training or development program that takes place within the physical workplace or training center, where employees attend courses, workshops, or training sessions in person, rather than through online or remote means. This type of training provides employees with hands-on experience, interactive sessions, and face-to-face interaction with trainers and colleagues.

In-person learning is important in scientific computing because it provides an opportunity for students to interact in a collaborative and engaging learning environment. Scientific computing involves the application of computational methods and tools to solve complex scientific problems, and in-person learning allows students to receive topic-specific instruction, understand pitfalls and receive practical guidance from experts in the field. Motivation and engagement is known to be higher and distraction are known to be lower during in-person learning, rather than online or self-study because it provides a structured, interactive and a more accountable learning environment. This can lead to better learning outcomes and a deeper understanding of scientific field under study.

Collaborating with peers on face-to-face basis allows for more personal and meaningful discussions and feedback. The scientific field is built on collaboration and networking with other students, instructors, and professionals in the field is an important aspect. Such networking, which is, arguably, easier when done in-person helps one build more personal connections. This can lead to better working relationships, new innovative collaborations, mentorships, job opportunities and building of mutual respect and trust. 

Ultimately, the choice between in-person vs. other methods such as virtual learning depends on individual needs, preferences, and circumstances. Some readers may benefit from a combination of both methods, while others may find that a particular approach suits them better than others.
