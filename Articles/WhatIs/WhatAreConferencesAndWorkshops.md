Conferences and workshops play a pivotal role in advancing scientific research in the field of scientific computing. These events offer researchers a valuabe platform to showcase their latest findings, discuss and exchange ideas with other experts, and cultivate collaborations that drive innovation in their field. Beyond knowledge-sharing and collaboration, attending conferences and workshops enables researchers to remain up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements in their field, enabling them to refine their research approach and stay ahead of the curve.

Conferences and workshops provide researchers with a unique opportunity to present their work to an audience of peers, fostering critical discussions that encourage the exchange of ideas and feedback. Through these platforms, researchers receive constructive criticism that enables them to fine-tune their ideas and approaches, resulting in the development of new insights, techniques, and approaches that can further advance their research agenda. Scientific computing software stacks are built for various applications from different domains. Conferences and workshops offer researchers a chance to connect with experts from other domains and fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge-sharing. These events also provide excellent opportunities for industry, academia, national laboratories, and other research organizations to connect and exchange notes. Several of these factors result in awareness of new funding and grant opportunities. With both formal and informal settings, conferences/worksops are considered good environments to build deeper meaningful relationships in one's colleagues and advance in the field.

Networking and career advancement opportunities are another significant outcome of attending conferences and workshops. Employers in scientific computing field often use these events to recruit talented interns/employees who possess the drive, enthusiasm, skills, knowledge, or experience to help them achieve their goals. These venues provide an opportunity for all these organizations to promote and highlight their mission, values, and the projects they are currently working on. For younger reasearchs, conferences/workshop provide a platform to showcase their work, whether it's through presenting a poster, giving a talk, or participating in a panel. This can help one gain recognition for their research and raise their profile in their field.

Being part of a conference organization committee member is important for established researchers because it allows them to contribute to the advancement of their field by shaping the content, format, and focus of the event. This involvement provides opportunties for networking and collaboration with other leading experts in the field, as well as enhances their professional reputation and visibility. Additionally also, serving on a conference organization committee allows established researchers to do mentoring and support younger researchers and emerging  talent/scholars, thereby contributing to the sustainability and growth of the field.

The scientific computing field offers several high-profile conferences and workshops that are held domestically in united states and internationally.
