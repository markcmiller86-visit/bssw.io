Conferences and workshops play a pivotal role as forums for members of industry, academia, national laboratories, and other research organizations to exchange scientific computing research.
These events offer researchers valueable opportunities to showcase their latest findings, discuss and exchange ideas with other experts, and cultivate collaborations that drive innovation in their field.
Beyond knowledge-sharing and collaboration, attending conferences and workshops helps researchers to learn about new funding and grant opportunities and to remain up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements in their field, enabling them to refine their research approach resulting in the development of new insights, techniques, and approaches that can further advance their research agenda.

Networking and career advancement opportunities are other significant outcomes of attending conferences and workshops.
Employers in scientific computing often use these events to recruit talented people who possess sought after skills, interests, knowledge and/or abilities.
These venues provide an opportunity for all these organizations to promote and highlight their mission, values and projects.
Through poster and panel sessions, newer researchers can find opportunities to showcase their work, gain recognition for their research and raise their profile in their field.

Volunteering to be part of a conference organizing committee is useful for established researchers because it allows them to contribute to the advancement of their field by shaping the content, format, and focus of these events as well as mentor and support newer researchers and emerging talent/scholars.

The scientific computing community offers several high-profile conferences and workshops that are held both domestically in the United States and internationally.
These include...

* SIAM/CSE
* IEEE VIZ
* Supercomputing

We shoud find links to the above too.
