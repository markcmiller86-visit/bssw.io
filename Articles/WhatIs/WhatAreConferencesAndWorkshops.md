Conferences and workshops are important for scientific research in scientific computing. These events offer researchers an exceptional platform to showcase their latest findings, discuss and exchange ideas with other experts, and cultivate collaborations that drive innovation in their field. Along with knowledge-sharing and collaboration, attending conferences and workshops enables reserchers to remain up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements in their field, enabling them to refine their research approach and stay ahead of the curve.

Conferences and workshops also provide researchers with a unique opportunity to present their work to a  audience of peers, fostering critical discussions that encourage the exchange of ideas and feedback. Through these platforms, researchers receive constructive criticism that enables them to fine-tune their ideas and approaches, resulting in the development of new insights, techniques, and approaches that can further advance their research agenda. Moreover, workshops offer a more focused and intensive learning experience than conferences, allowing researchers to delve deeper into specific topics or methods that can have significant implications for their research.
