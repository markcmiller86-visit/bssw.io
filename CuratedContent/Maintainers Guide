BSSw Fellow Alum Sumana Harihareswara produces an engaging newsletter. A recent edition features an Open Software Maintainer Guide focusing on skills for new maintainers. The author, as the founder of Changeset Consulting (changeset.nyc), draws on experience from clients to create the guide. The guide contains six resource documents: Recruiting Financial Sponsors; Deciding how to use your Project’s Money; Marketing, Publicity, Roadmaps, and Communications; Growing your Contributor Base; Handling Burnout and Career Planning; and Promoting Maintainers and Handling Conflict. In addition, the newsletter points out options for Maintainer Skills Workshops led by Sumana Harihareswara. 

The guide explores particularly difficult situational examples to help new maintainers sidestep problems. The document section on the Project’s Money includes budget planning that incorporates analysis of many possible future paths. The Career Planning document details some of the worst case situations when maintainers leave and how to minimize disasters. 

This guide shows that the work of maintainers goes well beyond coding tasks.  It is beneficial reading.
